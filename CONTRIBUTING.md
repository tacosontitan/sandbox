## Module Contributions
New modules are always welcome, however, please keep them confined to the `modules/public` directory.

## Improvements to Core Functionality
Any improvements to core functionality must be justified through an issue prior to creating a pull request.

## Improvements to Public Modules
Public modules can be improved by anyone at any time, so long as the output remains the same as prior to the improvement's implementation.

## Improvements to Personal Modules
I do not actively welcome improvements to my modules via pull requests. However, I do like to improve everything I can and learn from others, so if you spot an issue or something that could be improved, please create an issue with your recommendations or start a discussion.
