# ðŸŒ® Taco's Sandbox ðŸ“¦
Do you ever get tired of creating console app after console app just to test out ideas or concepts? Well, so do I! This sandbox utilizes reflection to enable a modularized approach to testing new ideas and concepts.

[![Example of runtime execution.](images/screenshot.jpg)](images/screenshot.jpg)

Implementation is as simple as deriving a new `class` from `ConsumableModule`:

```cs
internal sealed class HelloWorld : ConsumableModule {
    public HelloWorld() : base("hello", "Hello World", "Says hello to the world.") { }
    public override void Invoke() => PostMessage("Hello world!");
}
```

Then simply use `dotnet run` to start the sandbox and enter the key for your module when prompted:

> Successfully discovered 1 module(s).<br/>
> Please enter `help` for help, `exit` to exit, or a command key: hello<br/>
> Hello World: Hello world!

It's as simple as that! Welcome to my sandbox, wanna play?
